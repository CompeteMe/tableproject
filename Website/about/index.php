	What is this?

  </h2>
	<p>In this application, users can interact in real time through a virtual 
	table. You can use this table to share images, plan team strategies, play 
	card or board games, etc. Although this is not a game, one of its main focuses 
	is to allow any kind of board or card game to be easily playable through 
	this table. This is still under development, so it's not all games that can 
	be played, but I'm sure you can be a little creative and come up with new 
	ways of using this app. You can create and host games inside the application 
	and play with others in the web. If you have any questions or ideas, please 
	contact me.</p><br>
